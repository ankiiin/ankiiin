# Hi, I’m Anniken Hammerstad

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m currently studying front-end development and UX design, and I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly, and accessible digital experiences. I’m especially interested in how design and development work together, and I care a lot about how users experience the products I build.
